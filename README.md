Arduino compatible software for a ESP8266 WiFi MCU as part of the BuddihexTM Rotator Software System.

The ESP8266 Controller firmware listens to commands and responds as needed. It monitors the rotator position with a QMC5883L 3-axis magnetic sensor and controls the rotator motor with a L293D stepper motor controller.

Data is exchanged between the ESP8266 Controller and other applications over WiFi using UDP.
